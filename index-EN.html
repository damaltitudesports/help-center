					<h2>Order Processing</h2>

				<div class="card-body">
					<p>Once you’ve placed your order on Altitude Sports, the processing time will differ depending on when you place it. Note that the team processes orders between Monday and Friday, 9am to 5pm EST. If you place an order Friday night processing will begin Monday morning. The processing time is already incorporated into the aforementioned delivery time when you select your preferred method of shipping.</p>

					<h2>Estimated Delivery Date</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body" id="estimatedDelivery">
					<p>After choosing your preferred shipping method and courier, please check for your estimated delivery time in the first step of your shopping cart. Estimated delivery information is provided by the courier company. The processing time is already incorporated into the delivery time, but weekends and statutory holidays are not counted. Within Canada, we guarantee that your delivery will be made by the time indicated. Note that your delivery may arrive before the estimated delivery time provided by the courier company.</p>
					<p>If your order is shipped within Canada, and it arrives after the estimated delivery indicated on Altitude Sports, as provided by the courier company at the time the order was placed, we will gladly reimburse you the shipping fees you may have paid. Delays to orders due to circumstances out of our control, such as snowstorms, hurricanes, credit card verification procedures or postal strikes, will not be counted against the allocated time for delivery.</p>
					<p>For deliveries to the United States, and other countries around the world, the estimated delivery time cannot be guaranteed by Altitude Sports. Due to the fact courier companies sub-contract shipments to local companies, and the unknown variable of customs processing times, delivery times can be unpredictable and in rare instances delayed. For more information concerning this subject, please read the <a href="#shipping_13">following section.</a></p>

					<h2>In-Store Pickup: a practical and free option</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>If you happen to live near Mont-Tremblant, you may also pick up your order from that store, without paying any shipping fees. Simply choose this option when you are at the stage of choosing your shipping method in your shopping cart. Expect a delay of 7 to 8 business days for this shipping option. This delay exists because transfers from our warehouse to the stores occur only once a week. You will be contacted by telephone once the store has received your order. For security reasons, we oblige you to bring a printout of your receipt, the credit card used to pay for the order, and 2 pieces of identification when you pick up your order. You will also be asked to sign a document attesting to the pickup.</p>

					<h2>Receiving and picking up orders</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>For all receptions of orders shipped with FedEx, we require a signature confirming that you have indeed received your order, and not a stranger. This protects both you and Altitude Sports from cases of theft or conflict in the case of a delivery error.</p>
					<p>Although estimated delivery dates are almost always respected, we suggest you leave a window of 3 business days between the date of delivery and the date you absolutely require your order. This way if the courier company arrives when you are out, you will have ample time to pick it up from the post office. Furthermore, if a natural disaster, postal strike or any other event we cannot control should occur, the 3 business day window will not leave you high and dry. Please use forethought to prevent any unnecessary stress, because we do not want you leaving on your trip to the Alps without that new backpack.</p>

					<p>If you need to contact us outside of our business hours, please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@altitude-sports.com">info@altitude-sports.com</a> and write in the subject of the email « CANCELATION OF ORDER #0012345 ».</p>

					<h2>Where to have your order delivered</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>The courier companies we use to ship your orders deliver throughout the day, but usually between 9am and 6pm. We suggest having your order delivered to your usual daytime location. That way you increase your chances of being able to have your order delivered to you and being present to sign for it, and saving you the hassle of having to pick it up at the nearest post office.</p>
					<p>Ensure that you provide us with the correct and complete address to prevent incurring any return shipping fees if the courier cannot deliver the package to the address indicated.</p>

					<h2>Refusing delivery of a package, not claiming a package or wrong address</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>If you refuse your order at your door during delivery, it will be returned to our warehouse in Montreal. The fees associated with the return delivery are charged to us. The same outcome will occur to packages that are either undeliverable because no one is home during the multiple delivery attempts or the package is not picked up from the local post office after a certain number of days. The rules differ depending on the courier. Here are the links to <a href="http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/support/helpcentre/tracking/attempted_delivery.jsf?LOCALE=en">Canada Post</a> and <a href="https://www.fedex.com/">FedEx</a> for more details regarding this subject. Parcels delivered to a faulty address from a client’s mistake or from which the address was incomplete will also be returned to Altitude Sports.</p>
					<p>Other than the refusal of a parcel because it was damaged during the transportation or from a faulty address without being the responsibility of the client, Altitude Sports is not responsible for any shipping fee, broker fees or any other tax fees related to the return of a parcel to our warehouse.</p>
					<p>If we refuse the return of your items or if you have given us a faulty shipping address and we need to reship your parcel, a $25 fee will be charged to our Canadian customers to cover the re-shipping charges. For our United States clients, the fee is $40. For international orders, the re-shipping fee is $75. We will contact you if this occurs. If we have not heard back from you within 10 business days we will refund the order minus the shipping fees.</p>
					<p>If your order returns to us in “Return to sender” and that you do not wish to have this package resent to you &amp; prefer a refund, we will deduct $15 from your refund to cover the return shipping fees from all Canadian order. For orders being returned to us from the United States and other International country, our customer service will get in contact with you for more details.</p>

					<h2>We do reimbursements; not exchanges</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body">
					<p>Our experience dictates it's more advantageous for everyone that we do not offer exchanges because it's simpler to reimburse you for returned product. It's quicker and easier to consider each transaction separately; this way you don't need to wait until your refund is complete to order the correct product. If you’d prefer another size or color, simply order that style and send back the unwanted product at your earliest convenience. Placing this second order eliminates the need to wait for your refund to process, and ensures you get the correct product delivered to your door as soon as possible.</p>
					<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you wish to return a jacket in size small because you think the medium will fit better, you should do two things. First, return the small jacket. You’ll be refunded when that process is complete. Second, order the medium jacket, which will be delivered via the usual shipping process.</p>
					<p><strong>Advice: Order multiple sizes, colors, or styles of the same product.</strong></p>
					<p>If you're hesitating between sizes, colors, or models, we advise ordering several products so you can compare them, then just return the products you don’t like. This single order will limit your number of transactions and save time, all while ensuring you receive the specific product you want. It also guarantees you'll get the item you want before it sells out.</p>
					<p>Altitude Sports stocks many different brands and models, but certain products may be limited in quantities or colors. During our sales, specific styles sell out quickly.</p>

		<div id="accordionPrice" class="accordion">
			<div class="pt-2">
				<p>Altitude Sports is compelled to offer our customers the best pricing. If you have an inquiry about price matching or are requesting a pricing adjustment on a previously placed order, please contact our customer service team. One of our team members will gladly assist you.</p>
				<p>All price matching requests must meet the following conditions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you find the product you purchased from Altitude Sports is priced lower by our competitor, or if that product's price has decreased on our website within 15 days of your purchase, we will refund your account the price difference in Alti Dollars.</li>
					<li>We only consider a price matching competitor to be a North American-based business that is also an authorized dealer of the brand and product in question. A competitor must also be authorized to ship that brand and product to Canada.</li>
					<li>The product must be identical in brand, model, sizing, color, and from the same year of fabrication.</li>
					<li>The product must be in stock and available for immediate purchase from our competitor at the price you are requesting. We will not match out of stock products or sale pricing that has expired.</li>
					<li>Our customer service agents must be able to verify the requested price match via telephone or internet from the competitor. Verbal agreements are not eligible.</li>
					<li>When matching our competitor's product price, we include shipping fees charged by a competitor that apply to the cost of the product we have been requested to price match. Meaning, if a competitor is selling a product for 200$ plus a 50$ shipping fee, we will consider the total price matching cost to be 250$. This rule applies to any additional charges that we incur due to our price matching policy.</li>
					<li>We only offer price matching in Canadian Dollars. If a price match is requested on a product listed in American currency, we will use the daily US-to-Canadian dollar exchange rate based on the Bank of Canada to calculate the total cost of a product.</li>
					<li>Auction sites, liquidation and clearance sales, used products, demo or floor models, and unofficial websites are not eligible for price matching. We also do not match product prices from The Last Hunt or Amazon.</li>
					<li>Altitude Sports matches pricing on our website and in our store. We also match product pricing from both online and traditional retailers that meet our price matching requirements listed above.</li>
					<li>You can return a product we’ve price-matched for you. If you wish to purchase the same product (same colour and same year of fabrication) in a different size, but the item is no longer on sale, matching the lower price on a replacement item is entirely at our discretion. Be aware return shipping fees may apply.</li>
					<li>You can return a product we’ve price matched for you. If you wish to purchase the same product (same color and year of fabrication) in a different size, but the item is no longer on sale, we will gladly uphold the adjusted lower price of that product. Be aware return shipping fees may apply.</li>
					<li>We reserve the right to limit the number of products purchased under our price matching policy.</li>
					<li>Our price matching cannot be combined with any additional discounts or promotions. Only the 5% membership discount (if applicable) can be applied to the matched price of a product.</li>
					<li>Our Lowest Price Guarantee does not apply to products sold by Marketplace sellers (see <a href="/pages/marketplace-osprey"><u>Osprey</u></a> seller page).</li>

					<p>To know if your purchase qualifies for free standard shipping, simply add the item(s) to your shopping cart.

You will then be able to see if your order qualifies for free standard shipping with FedEx and/or Canada Post.</p>
					<p>If the standard method of shipping indicates a fee, this is either due to the remoteness of the delivery address, the dimensions of the order, or the exceptional weight of the order. We work hard to minimize these surcharges by negotiating the best possible prices with the courier companies, and by assuming most of the shipping fees for almost all of these situations. Canada is a large country, so we must draw certain lines to render our business viable. We appreciate your understanding.</p>
					<p>Please note that free returns are not applicable to products ordered from a <a href="#marketplace">Marketplace</a> seller.</p>

		<p>To improve your Boxing Day shopping experience, we’ve created the following FAQ list, a collection of the most Frequently Asked Questions from our clients in past years. The hope is that all your questions will be answered within. Then, all that’s left is to circle the date and set your alarm to find <a href="/pages/boxing-day">the best deals</a>.</p>

					<p>At Altitude Sports we have a price-matching policy that covers the 15 days after your purchase. If you purchase an item between now and Boxing Day, and either the price drops or you find the product cheaper elsewhere, we’ll match the price by crediting you for the price difference on the item in question.

					<h2>What brands will be discounted?</h2>

					<p>During Boxing Day, it is possible to find sales on brands that are rarely discounted, such as <a href="/collections/arcteryx">Arc’teryx</a>, <a href="/collections/the-north-face">The North Face</a>, <a href="/collections/quartz-co">Quartz Co.</a>, <a href="/collections/icebreaker">Icebreaker</a>, <a href="/collections/soia-kyo">SOIA &amp; KYO</a>, <a href="/collections/sorel">Sorel</a>, <a href="/collections/fjallraven">Fjällräven</a> and <a href="/pages/boxing-day">several others</a>. In all, 300+ brands will be discounted during Boxing Day. Specific brands may not be discounted at first, but they might go on sale later in the week. Our <a href="/pages/boxing-day">Boxing Day sales calendar</a> shows what day your favourite brands will be on sale. You can also subscribe to our newsletter to receive updates throughout the week on new discounts and promotions. In general, the brands that are not discounted on December 26th will remain full-price throughout the season.</p>

					<h2>Are sales final?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body" id="boxing-day-sale-finals">
					<p>No, they are not. Altitude Sports has a <a href="#returns_3">90-day return policy</a>. We encourage you to purchase multiple sizes of a product if you’re unsure of your size, because availability will be limited once Boxing Day is over. By doing this, you will increase your chances of finding the perfect fit. <a href="#returns">Our returns</a> are simple, straightforward and free for <a href="/products/membership">Altitude Sports Lifetime members</a> as well as our first-time customers.</p>

					<h2>What if the products I buy don’t fit?</h2>

					<h2>How can I get the biggest discount possible?</h2>

					<p>We suggest you follow these steps:</p>
					<p><strong>1.</strong> <a href="/pages/subscription-abonnement">Subscribe to our newsletter</a>, receive exclusive coupon codes and be the first to know about upcoming discounts.</p>
					<p><strong>2.</strong> Become an Altitude Sports Lifetime Member and receive an additional 5% off selected brands. You can become a member by <a href="/products/membership">purchasing our membership</a>, currently on sale for $9.99 (down from $24.99). It’s a one-time payment which applies to your first purchase and all future purchases made on Altitude Sports. You can purchase the membership at the same time as other products, so you can immediately benefit from the membership discount.</p>
					<p><i>Please note that the Membership discount and free returns are not applicable on products purchased from a <a href="#marketplace">Marketplace</a> seller.</i></p>

					<h2>Will I receive my order later than usual during Boxing Day sales, as more people are ordering from Altitude Sports at the same time?</h2>

					<p>At Altitude Sports, we’re proud to ship as quickly during high traffic periods as we do during the rest of the year. Our quick shipping is what sets us apart from the competition.

					<h2>Is Canada Post a reliable option for delivering my order?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body" id="boxing-day-canada-post-delivery">
					<p>Yes. Canada Post’s backlog caused by their now-ended rotating strike, has been greatly reduced.</p>
					<p>We highly recommend selecting Canada Post as your free shipping option as Canada Post has more easily accessible outlets to choose from, as opposed to any other provider in Canada. The return process is also much easier if you use Canada Post.</p>

					<h2>Are your discounts real or is your MSRP boosted so the discounts look unbelievably good?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="card-body" id="boxing-day-real-discounts">
					<p>Our discounts are most certainly real. Our regular prices are established based on the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP). They are the same year-round, and it is only the discount that varies. We also do not buy additional models of manufactured clothing or jackets to sell at discounted prices only on Boxing Day. The products that we sell during the discount period are part of collections from exclusive brands we carry all year-round.</p>
